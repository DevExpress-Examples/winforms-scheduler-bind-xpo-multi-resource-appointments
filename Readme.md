# WinForms Scheduler - Bind to multi-resource appointments with XPO

This example demonstrates how to use [Object-Relational Mapping Library (XPO)](https://docs.devexpress.com/XPO/1998/express-persistent-objects) to bind the WinForms Scheduler control with [multi-resource appointments](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/4217/controls-and-libraries/scheduler/examples/data-binding/how-to-enable-multi-resource-appointments)Â (the [AppointmentStorage.ResourceSharing](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraScheduler.AppointmentDataStorage.ResourceSharing) option is enabled).

Follow the steps below:

1. Reference the *DevExpress.Xpo.vX.y.dll* assembly.
2. Declare `XPAppointment` and `XPResource` classes derived from [XPObject](https://docs.devexpress.com/XPO/DevExpress.Xpo.XPObject).
3. Rebuild the solution.
4. Drop two [XPCollection](https://docs.devexpress.com/XPO/DevExpress.Xpo.XPCollection) components from the toolbox onto a Form. Name these components as "xpCollectionAppointments" and "xpCollectionResources".
5. Set their [ObjectClassInfo](https://docs.devexpress.com/XPO/DevExpress.Xpo.XPCollection.ObjectClassInfo) properties to the `XPAppointment` and `XPResource` objects, respectively.
6. Set theÂ [DeleteObjectOnRemove](https://docs.devexpress.com/XPO/DevExpress.Xpo.XPBaseCollection.DeleteObjectOnRemove)Â property of theÂ **xpCollectionAppointments** to **true**.
7. Set the `SchedulerStorage.Appointments.DataSource` property to `xpCollectionAppointments`.
8. Set the `SchedulerStorage.Resources.DataSource` property to `xpCollectionResources`.
9. Set up required [mappings](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/15468/controls-and-libraries/scheduler/data-binding/mappings) for `AppointmentStorage` and `ResourceStorage`.
10. Handle [SchedulerStorage.AppointmentsChanged](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraScheduler.SchedulerDataStorage.AppointmentsChanged) and [SchedulerStorage.AppointmentsInserted](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraScheduler.SchedulerDataStorage.AppointmentsInserted) events to save persistent objects.
